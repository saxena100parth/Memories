Social media application where user can share places with image and location with other users.



## what I build and which problem I want to solve.

I build an app where users can share their favourite places or places they feel are worth sharing, where each place has an image, a location, and a title. so, users can share it with other users.
In other words, if you're a user or a visitor in this application, you can view a list of users and by clicking on any user you can see the places that the user shared.
The great thing about this app is that it's not too complex and yet it has all the important pieces
you want to have such an app.
Specifically, I have used all the core CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete.


Tech stack- React.js, Node.js, Express.js & MongoDB.
